            In our work and daily life, we often come into contact with many
            tutorials. The common tutorials are in the form of documents or
            videos. As a tutorial, the important purpose is to tell learners in
            what situation to do what kind of operation. Documents can be good
            to do this, but their disadvantage is also very obvious, that is,
            it’s boring to read and not intuitive. Compared with documents,
            video tutorials can better reflect the real operating environment
            and are more interesting. However, if you want to describe the
            operating steps, you need to add dubbing or subtitles, and the
            production and maintenance costs are relatively high.
          </p>
          <p>
            To solve the shortcomings and difficulties of traditional tutorial
            production, we have developed Storyteller, an application that is
            designed as a no-code interactive tutorial builder. Storyteller can
            be used for product demonstrations or as interactive product
            instructions to help promote products, as well as for teaching and
            remote instruction. After reading the above description, if you
            still don’t know what kind of product Storyteller is, you can move
            to the
            <a
              href="https://storyteller.webzard.io/?utm_source=en-post&amp;utm_medium=inline-link"
              >official website</a
            >, where there are product demonstrations and instructions made with
            Storyteller itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why Stotyteller can have the confidence to solve the shortcomings of
            traditional tutorials? This is due to Storyteller&#39;s division of
            tutorial production scenarios. We divide the tutorial production
            environment into web pages, terminals and videos, and we use unique
            media formats for web pages and terminals. For example, in the web
            scenario, we use the open-source web page recording and playback
            tool:
            <a href="https://www.rrweb.io/">rrweb</a>, which is capable of
            recording and restoring a web page in a small size, lossless, stable
            and secure way. When users see a realistic, responsive storyteller
            web tutorial, they are not operating a real web page in a production
            environment, but a perfect copy of the web page, even including the
            hover effect of a button. There is no need to worry about security
            and stability because the page is running in a sandbox environment
            and no actual business is performed on the page. Some developers may
            say that &quot;I can implement these immersive and lossless
            tutorials by myself using user-guided tools like intro.js. Why do I
            need Storyteller?” Indeed, developers can achieve all of this by
            writing code, but storyteller provides a very simple and fast way
            that is suitable for all people. Users can make realistic user
            guides for their web applications without writing a line of code and
            this is the no-code feature of Storyteller.
          </p>

            Although Storyteller is not yet at the stage of public release, it
            is very close to completion and you can experience its core
            functions and features on the official website. If you want to
            actually experience it for the first time and stay in the loop, you
            can submit your email address on the official website and we will
            make contact with you soon. If you encounter problems in the trial
            process or have better ideas, you can also be the first to get in
            touch with us. In the future, in addition to continuously improving
            existing functions, Storyteller will also introduce a story square
            function for users to share tutorials and a collaborative function
            that supports multiple people to edit tutorials at the same time.
